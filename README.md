# i3-papers: Research on Hyper-Efficient LLM Architectures

This repository serves as the central hub for independent research into i3 (Innovative, Intelligent, Inherently Efficient) architectures. Our core mission is to redefine the computational scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) by prioritizing architectural efficiency over brute-force hardware scale, proving that SOTA performance is accessible to all.
